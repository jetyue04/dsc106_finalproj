            <H1>Male Mice: More Stable or Sterotype?</H1>

    <p>
        Historically, female subjects have been excluded from medical research due to the belief that male specimens are generally more stable. While this may be true due to the existence in female estrous cycles, is it really true if we account for this phenomenon? Let's take a closer look at this concept in a colony of mice.  
    </p>

    <h2>A Peek Into the Colony üêÅ</h2>
    <p>
        Over 14 days, a group of 26 mice (13 male, 13 female) had activity and tempreature levels recorded. Here is a a peek at their tempreature levels averaged over four days. Click on an individual mouse line for more information:
    </p>
    <div id="stats-display">  
        <strong>All Mice</strong> <br>
        <strong>Mean Temperature:</strong> 36.94¬∞C<br>
        <strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 0.8¬∞C
    </div>
    
    <div id="chart"></div>
    <h2>Distance From the Mean & Cumulative Variability ü§î</h2>
    <p>
        Just looking at raw temperatures across all mice, it's not really clear which group is more variable! Let's group together the dataset based on gender, taking the mean of all mice in one gender. Let's also subtract each datapoint by the mean for both groups, shifting means of each curve to 0. We can examine both the variability at each point and the cumulative variance over time.

        <div class="chart-box">
            <div class="chart-title">Temperature Variability</div>
            <div id="chart2"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="chart-box">
            <div class="chart-title">Cumulative Variability</div>
            <div id="chart3"></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        It seems that Male mice tend to have more extreme values than female mice! Looking at the cumulative variance, we can see that the variability of male mice diverges much more quickly than female mice over time.
    </p>

    <p>Female specimens exclusion from research cannot be excused to males possessing less variance. Female specimens tend to show less variability overall.</p>
