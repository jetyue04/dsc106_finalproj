        Mice are a common model organism in biology. They are small, easy to keep, and reproduce quickly. This makes them ideal for studying genetics, behavior, and disease. In this project, we will explore core body temperature and activity levels in a mice. We will use data visualization to better understand the data and draw conclusions from it.

    <h2> A Peek Into the Colony</h2>
    <p>
        Over 14 days, a group of 26 mice (13 male, 13 feamale) had activity and tempreature levels recorded. Here is a a peek at their tempreature levels averaged over the four days. Click on individual line for more information:

        <strong>All Mice</strong> <br>
        <strong>Mean Temperature:</strong> 36.94°C<br>
        <strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 0.8°C

    <h2> Temperature Variation: Which gender is more stable?</h2>

    <div id="chart2"></div>

    <p>
        The way that we recorded variance is that we graphed each individual 
        mouse from both the male and female. Then we grouped by gender and 
        subtracted the male data by the male mean, and also the female data 
        by the female male in order for both lines to be around y=0. And with 
        this visualization, we see that the male mice differ a lot more from 
        its respective mean than the female mice.

    <h2> Write-up:</h2>

    <p class = 'write-up'>
        So far, we have brainstormed various ideas for visualizing the variance 
        in body temperature. We considered using heat maps, histograms, and box 
        plots. However, we decided to stick with line graphs and add animations 
        to them. Our plan is to apply an absolute value to the variance line plot 
        and calculate the area under the curve to determine which variance is 
        higher. This will help us draw conclusions from the data. Additionally, 
        we consulted Professor Ben Smarr, who provided insights from his own 
        research on the topic. He explained his methods and findings, which 
        showed that female mice have less variance in body temperature compared 
        to male mice.

        One of the most challenging aspects of this project will be animating 
        the line graph to show the area under the curve over time. We aim to 
        illustrate how the difference between the two genders increases as time 
        progresses. Additionally, we want to present the area under the curve in
        a clear and comprehensible manner, avoiding the appearance of a typical 
        line plot. Another issue we encountered was selecting an appropriate 
        color scheme for the variance plot. Due to the significant amount of 
        noise, any combination involving blue and another color tended to look 
        cluttered. Thus, another challenge is to ensure the visualization is both 
        aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. Furthermore, we plan to enhance 
        the interactivity of the first graph. Currently, when a line is clicked, 
        it remains a light color unless hovered over. We intend to modify this 
        behavior so that the line changes to a darker color upon selection, 
        improving the overall user experience.
